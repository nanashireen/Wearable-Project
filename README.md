# Wearable-Project

Our project's goal is a wearable wristband that monitors the wearer's stress levels. This wristband measures the wearer's heart rate (EKG), sweat levels, and skin temperature and then uses these results to determine stress levels. This data will also be accessible within our app. It will also notify users when their stress levels are too high using haptics and a visual alarm, as well as show them breathing exercises to assist lower stress. Our device will be aimed towards young people, particularly those pursuing higher education.â€‹
